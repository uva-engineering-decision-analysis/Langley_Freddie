# Introduction
- The cost of Type 2 Diabetes medication has skyrocketed in the 21st century. 
- The cost of insulin can surge to over $250 for a vial of insulin and due to the sensitivity of a patient’s glucose level, multiple vials may be required for their therapeutic intervention. 
---
# Problem
- Patient C has been diagnosed with a chronic disease called Diabetes.
- Patient C has been experiencing A1C test results if 10.4% and 11.1%. The standard that patients should shoot for is under 5.5%.

# Objective
To maximize the quality of health subject to constraints of medication expenditures
1)	Which options will be clinically effective in achieving the A1c within the preferred threshold.
2)	If there is more than one drug option that achieves the stage 1 objective , which will be the drug to achieve the objective at the least cost.

# Effectiveness
We measure effectiveness in the difference between A1C through percentages. For example, If a patient has an A1C of 10%, a 1% predicted effectiveness would lower the A1C to 9%.

# Decision Model
## Stage 1
This stage is very important because it provides the practice of medical ethics within the model.
1) Input the patient's A1C
2) From the effectiveness data, a selection of multiple drug options will be presneted that meet the clinical threshold.
## Stage 2
To provide a drug from the filtered list that is the least expensive.
---
# Payoffs
The maximum payoff would be an A1C of 7%. Per the Mayo Clinic, the target A1C range for a patient with diabetes is less than 7%. A minimum payoff would be an A1C of 8%. 
---
# Predictive Model
Using the percentage of the treatment effectiveness, we will subtract that amount from the baseline A1C.
| Drug       | Effectiveness          | Cost to the Patient | Overall Cost|
| ------------- |:-------------:| -----:|-----: |
| Lifestyle Intervention  (Losing 10% of Body Fat)    | .66% | Varies | Varies|
| Lifestyle Intervention + Metformin    | .66%-2.5%| Cost of Food and Gym Memebership + Cost of Metformin| Varies |
| Insulin      | 1%-2.5% |$50-$1122 |$182-$1288 |
| Biguanides  |  1.3%-2.5% |$4-$619.48 |$7-$2250 |
| Sulfonylureas | 1-2% | $9-$42 |$7-$371 |
| Thiazolidinediones |.5-1.25% |$12.00-$181.33 | $70-$203|
| Dipeptidyl-peptidase 4 (DPP-4) inhibitors | .5%-.8% |  $113-$498| $344-$596|

## Expectations
After the model has been executed, I am expecting to be provided a predicted drug treatment option that first satisfies the A1C followed with a filtered option. Finally, a single option that is the cheapest for the required A1C.
